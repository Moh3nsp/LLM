# 🔥 Token to Transformer — An End-to-End Guide to Building Large Language Models

Welcome to **Token to Transformer**,a hands-on and modular implementation of a complete Large Language Model pipeline. Whether you're new to the field or looking to deepen your understanding of transformers and LLMs, this repository offers a practical guide to the architecture and functioning of cutting-edge language models like GPT

## 🌟 Why This Repository?

Building a working LLM requires understanding several deeply interconnected concepts. This repo is not just code — it’s a learning journey.

✔️ Ideal for **researchers**, **ML engineers**, **students**, and **enthusiasts**  
✔️ Focused on **clarity**, **modularity**, and **educational value**  
✔️ Covers the **entire LLM lifecycle**, from raw text to a fine-tuned model
